      <p>
       Relations between the Soviet Union and the United States were
          driven by a complex interplay of ideological, political, and
          economic factors, which led to shifts between cautious cooperation
          and often bitter superpower rivalry over the years.  The distinct
          differences in the political systems of the two countries often
          prevented them from reaching a mutual understanding on key policy
          issues and even, as in the case of the Cuban missile crisis,
          brought them to the brink of war.
      </p>
      <p>
       The United States government was initially hostile to the
          Soviet leaders for taking Russia out of World War I and was opposed
          to a state ideologically based on communism.  Although the United
          States embarked on a famine relief program in the Soviet Union in
          the early 1920s and American businessmen established commercial
          ties there during the period of the New Economic Policy (1921–29),
          the two countries did not establish diplomatic relations until
          1933.  By that time, the totalitarian nature of Joseph Stalin's
          regime presented an insurmountable obstacle to friendly relations
          with the West.  Although World War II brought the two countries
          into alliance, based on the common aim of defeating Nazi Germany,
          the Soviet Union's aggressive, antidemocratic policy toward Eastern
          Europe had created tensions even before the war ended.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Soviet Union and the United States stayed far apart during
          the next three decades of superpower conflict and the nuclear and
          missile arms race.  Beginning in the early 1970s, the Soviet regime
          proclaimed a policy of détente and sought increased economic
          cooperation and disarmament negotiations with the West.  However,
          the Soviet stance on human rights and its invasion of Afghanistan
          in 1979 created new tensions between the two countries.  These
          tensions continued to exist until the dramatic democratic changes
          of 1989–91 led to the collapse during this past year of the
          Communist system and opened the way for an unprecedented new
          friendship between the United States and Russia, as well as the
          other new nations of the former Soviet Union.

      Early Cooperation: American Famine Relief
     </h2>
     <div class="section_intro">
      <p>
       After the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, the ensuing Civil
          War produced acute food shortages in southwestern Russia. 
          Wartime devastation was compounded by two successive seasons of
          drought, and by 1920 it was clear that a full-scale famine was
          under way in the Volga River Valley, Crimea, Ukraine, and
          Armenia.  Conditions were so desperate that in early 1920 the
          Soviet government sent out a worldwide appeal for food aid to
          avert the starvation of millions of people.
      </p>
      <p>
       Several volunteer groups in the United States and Europe had
          by then organized relief programs, but it became clear that help
          was needed on a larger scale because an estimated 10 to 20
          million lives were at stake.  Although it had not officially
          recognized the Soviet regime, the United States government was
          pressed from many sides to intervene, and in August 1920 an
          informal agreement was negotiated to begin a famine relief
          program.  In 1921 President Warren Harding appointed Herbert
          Hoover, then secretary of commerce, to organize the relief
          effort.
      </p>
      <p>
       Congress authorized $20 million, and Hoover proceeded to
          organize the American Relief Administration (ARA) to do the job. 
          Under Hoover's terms, the ARA was to be a completely American-run
          relief program for the transport, storage, and delivery of relief
          supplies (mainly food and seed grain) to those in the famine
          region.  After Soviet officials agreed, hundreds of American
          volunteers were dispatched to oversee the program.  The ARA
          gradually earned the trust of the local Communist authorities and
          was given a virtually free hand to distribute thousands of tons
          of grain, as well as clothing and medical supplies.  This
          remarkable humanitarian effort was credited with saving many
          millions of lives.
      </p>
      <p>
       ARA aid continued into 1923, by which time local farms were
          again producing and the famine's grip was broken.  Hoover and his
          ARA were later honored by the Soviet government for the care and
          generosity that the United States had shown in this desperate
          crisis.

      Early Cooperation: Economic Cooperation
     </h2>
     <div class="section_intro">
      <p>
       During the 1920s and early 1930s, tensions between the
          Soviet Union and the West eased somewhat, particularly in the
          area of economic cooperation.  Following their consolidation of
          political power, the Bolsheviks faced the same economic challenge
          as had the government ministers of the tsarist regime:  how to
          efficiently organize the vast natural and human resources of the
          Soviet Union.  The economic situation was made even more
          difficult by the immense social and economic dislocation caused
          by World War I, the revolutions of 1917, and the Civil War of
          1918–21.
      </p>
      <p>
       As factories stood idle and famine raged in the countryside,
          Vladimir Lenin instituted the New Economic Policy (NEP) in 1921
          to infuse energy and direction into the fledgling Communist-
          controlled economy.  NEP retreated from Communist orthodoxy and 
          opened up the Soviet monolith economically.
      </p>
      <p>
       For a variety of reasons—compassion for the sufferings of
          the Soviet peoples, sympathy for the great “socialist
          experiment,” but primarily for the pursuit of profit—Western
          businessmen and diplomats began opening contacts with the Soviet
          Union.  Among these persons were Averell Harriman, Armand Hammer,
          and Henry Ford, who sold tractors to the Soviet Union.  Such
          endeavors facilitated commercial ties between the Soviet Union
          and the United States, establishing the basis for further
          cooperation, dialogue, and diplomatic relations between the two
          countries.  This era of cooperation was never solidly
          established, however, and it diminished as Joseph Stalin
          attempted to eradicate vestiges of capitalism and to make the
          Soviet Union economically self-sufficient.

      Soviet and American Communist Parties
     </h2>
     <div class="section_intro">
      <p>
       The Soviet Communist party evolved from the Russian Social
          Democratic Labor Party's Bolshevik wing formed by Vladimir Lenin
          in 1903.  Lenin believed that a well-disciplined, hierarchically
          organized party was necessary to lead the working class in
          overthrowing capitalism in Russia and the world.  In November
          1917, the Bolsheviks seized power in St. Petersburg (then called
          Petrograd) and shortly thereafter began using the term Communist
          to describe themselves.  In March 1918, the Bolsheviks named
          their party the Russian Communist Party (Bolshevik).  The next
          year, they created the Communist International (Comintern) to
          control the Communist movement throughout the world.  After the
          Comintern's dissolution in 1943, the Soviet party's Central
          Committee continued to use Communist parties from other nations
          as instruments of Soviet foreign policy.  Each national party was
          required to adhere to the Leninist principle of subordinating
          members and organizations unconditionally to the decisions of
          higher authorities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Strongly influenced by the success of the Bolshevik
          Revolution, American socialists and radicals met in Chicago in
          1919 to organize an American Communist party.  But the Americans
          were so divided they created two parties instead.  One group
          consisted primarily of relatively recent Russian and East
          European immigrants, who emphasized adherence to Marxist
          orthodoxy and proletarian revolution.  The other group, dominated
          by native-born, somewhat more pragmatic American radicals, sought
          mass influence.  Such conflicting goals combined with the
          discrepancy between Communist doctrine and American reality, kept
          the Communist movement in the United States a small sectarian
          movement.
      </p>
      <p>
       In 1922 the Comintern forced the two American parties, which
          consisted of about 12,000 members, to amalgamate and to follow
          the party line established in Moscow.  Although membership in the
          American party rose to about 75,000 by 1938, following the Great
          Depression, many members left the party after the signing of the
          Nazi-Soviet Nonaggression Pact of 1939.  Others left in 1956
          after Nikita Khrushchev exposed some of Stalin's crimes and
          Soviet forces invaded Hungary.  Only the hard-core members
          remained after such reversals of Soviet policy.  The American
          party, a significant although never major political force in the
          United States, became further demoralized when Boris Yeltsin
          outlawed the Communist party in Russia in August 1991 and opened
          up the archives, revealing the continued financial as well as
          ideological dependency of the American Communists on the Soviet
          party up until its dissolution.

      World War II: Alliance
     </h2>
     <div class="section_intro">
      <p>
       Despite deep-seated mistrust and hostility between the
          Soviet Union and the Western democracies, Nazi Germany's invasion
          of the Soviet Union in June 1941 created an instant alliance
          between the Soviets and the two greatest powers in what the
          Soviet leaders had long called the "imperialist camp":  Britain
          and the United States.  Three months after the invasion, the
          United States extended assistance to the Soviet Union through its
          Lend-Lease Act of March 1941.  Before September 1941, trade
          between the United States and the Soviet Union had been conducted
          primarily through the Soviet Buying Commission in the United
          States.
      </p>
      <p>
       Lend-Lease was the most visible sign of wartime cooperation
          between the United States and the Soviet Union.  About $11
          billion in war matériel was sent to the Soviet Union under that
          program.  Additional assistance came from U.S. Russian War Relief
          (a private, nonprofit organization) and the Red Cross.  About
          seventy percent of the aid reached the Soviet Union via the
          Persian Gulf through Iran; the remainder went across the Pacific
          to Vladivostok and across the North Atlantic to Murmansk.  Lend-Lease to the Soviet Union officially ended in September 1945. 
          Joseph Stalin never revealed to his own people the full
          contributions of Lend-Lease to their country's survival, but he
          referred to the program at the 1945 Yalta Conference saying,
          “Lend-Lease is one of Franklin Roosevelt's most remarkable and
          vital achievements in the formation of the anti-Hitler alliance.”
      </p>
      <p>
       Lend-Lease matériel was welcomed by the Soviet Union, and
          President Roosevelt attached the highest priority to using it to
          keep the Soviet Union in the war against Germany.  Nevertheless,
          the program did not prevent friction from developing between the
          Soviet Union and the other members of the anti-Hitler alliance. 
          The Soviet Union was annoyed at what seemed to it to be a long
          delay by the allies in opening a “second front” of the Allied
          offensive against Germany.  As the war in the east turned in
          favor of the Soviet Union, and despite the successful Allied
          landings in Normandy in 1944, the earlier friction intensified
          over irreconcilable differences about postwar aims within the
          anti-Axis coalition.  Lend-Lease helped the Soviet Union push the
          Germans out of its territory and Eastern Europe, thus
          accelerating the end of the war.  With Stalin's takeover of
          Eastern Europe, the wartime alliance ended, and the Cold War
          began.

      World War II: American POWs and MIAs
     </h2>
     <div class="section_intro">
      <p>
       The guns of distant battles fell silent long ago, but
          unanswered questions concerning United States servicemen missing
          in action and unrepatriated prisoners of war continue to concern
          the nation.  Recently, the missing and prisoners of war from the
          Vietnam War have been the focus of attention.
      </p>
      <p>
       But Soviet archival documents—from an earlier era after
          World War II—reveal that Americans were detained, and even
          perished, in the vast Soviet GULAG.  To find out additional
          information about Americans liberated from German prison camps by
          the Red Army and then interned in Soviet camps, the U.S./Russian
          Joint Commission on POW/MIAs was formed early in 1992.  Library
          of Congress officials, among others, have been authorized to
          research Russian archival materials on the subject in Moscow.
      </p>
      <p>
       Through such efforts and additional cooperation, the fate of
          those missing in the Cold War may become known as well.  Russian
          news reports tell of a United States B-29 aircraft shot down by
          Soviet interceptors over the Baltic Sea in April 1950.  One of
          the Soviet pilots who downed the B-29 reported that the aircraft
          was recovered from the sea, but the fate of the crew is unknown.
      </p>
      <p>
       The history of warfare cruelly suggests that some questions
          concerning the missing in action and prisoners of war will never
          be answered.  Nevertheless, candor, goodwill, and a spirit of
          cooperation on all sides can minimize such questions.  The
          opening of archives is a step forward in getting at the truth
          which can clear up the confusion and suspicion created in the
          past.

      <p>
       After the war, disputes between the
          Soviet Union and the Western democracies, particularly over the
          Soviet takeover of East European states,  led Winston Churchill
          to warn in 1946 that an “iron curtain” was descending through the
          middle of Europe.  For his part, Joseph Stalin deepened the
          estrangement between the United States and the Soviet Union when
          he asserted in 1946 that World War II was an unavoidable and
          inevitable consequence of “capitalist imperialism” and implied
          that such a war might reoccur.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Cold War was a period of East-West competition, tension,
          and conflict short of full-scale war, characterized by mutual
          perceptions of hostile intention between military-political
          alliances or blocs.  There were real wars, sometimes called
          “proxy wars” because they were fought by Soviet allies rather
          than the USSR itself—along with competition for influence in
          the Third World, and a major superpower arms race.
      </p>
      <p>
       After Stalin's death, East-West relations went through
          phases of alternating relaxation and confrontation, including a
          cooperative phase during the 1960s and another, termed détente,
          during the 1970s.  A final phase during the late 1980s and early
          1990s was hailed by President Mikhail Gorbachev, and especially
          by the president of the new post-Communist Russian republic,
          Boris Yeltsin, as well as by President George Bush, as beginning
          a partnership between the two states that could address many
          global problems.

      Cold War: Soviet Perspectives
     </h2>
     <div class="section_intro">
      <p>
       After World War II, Joseph Stalin saw the world as divided
          into two camps:  imperialist and capitalist regimes on the one
          hand, and the Communist and progressive world on the other.  In
          1947, President Harry Truman also spoke of two diametrically
          opposed systems:  one free, and the other bent on subjugating
          other nations.
      </p>
      <p>
       After Stalin's death, Nikita Khrushchev stated in 1956 that
          imperialism and capitalism could coexist without war because the
          Communist system had become stronger.  The Geneva Summit of 1955
          among Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States,
          and the Camp David Summit of 1959 between Eisenhower and
          Khrushchev raised hopes of a more cooperative spirit between East
          and West.  In 1963 the United States and the Soviet Union signed
          some confidence-building agreements, and in 1967 President Lyndon
          Johnson met with Soviet Prime Minister Aleksei Kosygin in
          Glassboro, New Jersey.  Interspersed with such moves toward
          cooperation, however, were hostile acts that threatened broader
          conflict, such as the Cuban missile crisis of October 1962 and
          the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia of 1968.
      </p>
      <p>
       The long rule of Leonid Brezhnev (1964–1982) is now referred
          to in Russia as the “period of stagnation.”  But the Soviet
          stance toward the United States became less overtly hostile in
          the early 1970s.  Negotiations between the United States and the
          Soviet Union resulted in summit meetings and the signing of
          strategic arms limitation agreements.  Brezhnev proclaimed in
          1973 that peaceful coexistence was the normal, permanent, and
          irreversible state of relations between imperialist and Communist
          countries, although he warned that conflict might continue in the
          Third World.  In the late 1970s, growing internal repression and
          the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan led to a renewal of Cold War
          hostility.
      </p>
      <p>
       Soviet views of the United States changed once again after
          Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in early 1985.  Arms control
          negotiations were renewed, and President Reagan undertook a new
          series of summit meetings with Gorbachev that led to arms
          reductions and facilitated a growing sympathy even among
          Communist leaders for more cooperation and the rejection of a
          class-based, conflict-oriented view of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
       With President Yeltsin's recognition of independence for the
          other republics of the former USSR and his launching of a full-
          scale economic reform program designed to create a market
          economy, Russia was pledged at last to overcoming both the
          imperial and the ideological legacies of the Soviet Union.

      Cold War: Cuban Missile Crisis
     </h2>
     <div class="section_intro">
      <p>
       According to Nikita Khrushchev's memoirs, in May 1962 he
          conceived the idea of placing intermediate-range nuclear missiles
          in Cuba as a means of countering an emerging lead of the United
          States in developing and deploying strategic missiles.  He also
          presented the scheme as a means of protecting Cuba from another
          United States-sponsored invasion, such as the failed attempt at
          the Bay of Pigs in 1961.
      </p>
      <p>
       After obtaining Fidel Castro's approval, the Soviet Union
          worked quickly and secretly to build missile installations in
          Cuba.  On October 16, President John Kennedy was shown
          reconnaissance photographs of Soviet missile installations under
          construction in Cuba.  After seven days of guarded and intense
          debate in the United States administration, during which Soviet
          diplomats denied that installations for offensive missiles were
          being built in Cuba, President Kennedy, in a televised address on
          October 22, announced the discovery of the installations and
          proclaimed that any nuclear missile attack from Cuba would be
          regarded as an attack by the Soviet Union and would be responded
          to accordingly.  He also imposed a naval quarantine on Cuba to
          prevent further Soviet shipments of offensive military weapons
          from arriving there.
      </p>
      <p>
       During the crisis, the two sides exchanged many letters and
          other communications, both formal and “back channel.”  Khrushchev
          sent letters to Kennedy on October 23 and 24 indicating the
          deterrent nature of the missiles in Cuba and the peaceful
          intentions of the Soviet Union.  On October 26, Khrushchev sent
          Kennedy a long rambling letter seemingly proposing that the
          missile installations would be dismantled and personnel removed
          in exchange for United States assurances that it or its proxies
          would not invade Cuba.  On October 27, another letter to Kennedy
          arrived from Khrushchev, suggesting that missile installations in
          Cuba would be dismantled if the United States dismantled its
          missile installations in Turkey.  The American administration
          decided to ignore this second letter and to accept the offer
          outlined in the letter of October 26.  Khrushchev then announced
          on October 28 that he would dismantle the installations and
          return them to the Soviet Union, expressing his trust that the
          United States would not invade Cuba.  Further negotiations were
          held to implement the October 28 agreement, including a United
          States demand that Soviet light bombers also be removed from
          Cuba, and to specify the exact form and conditions of United
          States assurances not to invade Cuba.
